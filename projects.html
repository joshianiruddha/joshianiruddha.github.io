                    <h3>3. Identify fraudulent transactions by using Big Data Architecture</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.  As we know, credit card transactions are a common risk in the finance industry, resulting in financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. The credit card transaction predictions are based on historical data, the user profile, and transaction location. This project uses the machine learning predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions.</p>

                    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of a life, connecting a wide range of devices to the internet for enhanced functionality, convenience, remote monitoring and optimization. From smart home appliances to industrial sensors, IoT devices collect, process, and exchange data. However, the these devices are prone to cyber attacks. This paper presents a data science approach to address this challenge, focusing on the development and evaluation of a predictive model to identify malicious cyberattacks on IoT devices. </p>
